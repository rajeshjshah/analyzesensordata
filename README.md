Analyze sensor data generated by Samsung Smart phones.
=====================================================

This script is used to generate tidy set as per the requirement of assignment. Steps below describes the flow of the program and critical variables.

1) Scripts expects that samsung data is in working directory. After extracting zip file set the working directory as "<Extraction directory>/UCI HAR Dataset/". 
This can be set using "setwd()" or using RSTUDIO GUI.

2) "read.table()" command is used to read all the required files.

3) "mergedDataset" is created by using "cbind()" command on training set and test set.

4) "grep()" is used to extract columns having mean and std pattern in their names. "toupper()" is used to ensure we capture all the varoations.

5) "subset()" command is used to extract required columns from "mergedDataset". The result is stored in "extractstdmeancolnames".

6) "Subject" and "Activity" columns are merged with "extractstdmeancolnames" using "cbind()" function.

7) "Aggregate()" function is used to calculate mean and result is stored in variable "meandata".

8) Descriptive activity names are assigned using "match()" function.

9) "write.table()" is used to create the output file "tidy_data_set.txt".

10) Output file will be created in working directory.
